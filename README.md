# ts-esbuild-react

[![Node CI](https://github.com/nathanjhood/ts-esbuild-react/actions/workflows/node.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nathanjhood/ts-esbuild-react/actions/workflows/node.yaml)

The `create-react-app` Typescript template's boilerplate code, powered by esbuild instead of `react-scripts`'s Webpack implementation.

Just something basic I need to investigate for other purposes in other projects, elsewhere.

Nothing too interesting here.
